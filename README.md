***As of v0.1.0, this library officially supports Ember 1.10 through to 2.0+ (Canary), and (aside from a few buggy versions), Ember Data pre-1.0 through to 2.0+ (Canary).  We plan to support 1.10 for the foreseeable future.***

Demo: [hhff.github.io/ember-infinity/](http://hhff.github.io/ember-infinity/)

Simple, flexible infinite scrolling for Ember CLI Apps.  Works out of the box
with the [Kaminari Gem](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari.git).

Inspired by @bantic's [Ember Infinite Scroll](https://github.com/bantic/ember-infinite-scroll)
repo, but without using controllers, in preparation for Ember 2.0.

## Installation

`ember install ember-infinity`

## Basic Usage

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import InfinityRoute from "ember-infinity/mixins/route";

export default Ember.Route.extend(InfinityRoute, {
  model() {
    /* Load pages of the Product Model, starting from page 1, in groups of 12. */
    return this.infinityModel("product", { perPage: 12, startingPage: 1 });
  }
});
```

Then, you'll need to add the Infinity Loader component to your template, like so:

```hbs
{{#each model as |product|}}
  <h1>{{product.name}}</h1>
  <h2>{{product.description}}</h2>
{{/each}}

{{infinity-loader infinityModel=model}}
```

Now, whenever the `infinity-loader` is in view, it will send an action to the route
(the one where you initialized the infinityModel) to start loading the next page.

When the new records are loaded, they will automatically be pushed into the Model array.

## Advanced Usage

### JSON Request/Response Customization

By default, ember-infinity will send pagination parameters as part of a GET request as follows

```
/items?per_page=5&page=1
```

and will expect to receive metadata in the response payload via a `total_pages` param in a `meta` object

```js
{
  items: [
    {id: 1, name: 'Test'},
    {id: 2, name: 'Test 2'}
  ],
  meta: {
    total_pages: 3
  }
}
```

If you wish to customize some aspects of the JSON contract for pagination, you may do so via your routes. For example, you may want to customize the following:

- perPageParam: "per",              // instead of "per_page"
- pageParam: "pg",                  // instead of "page"
- totalPagesParam: "meta.total",    // instead of "meta.total_pages"

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import InfinityRoute from "ember-infinity/mixins/route";

export default Ember.Route.extend(InfinityRoute, {

  model() {
    /* Load pages of the Product Model, starting from page 1, in groups of 12. Also set query params by handing off to infinityModel */
    return this.infinityModel("product", { perPage: 12, startingPage: 1, perPageParam: "per", pageParam: "pg", totalPagesParam: "meta.total" });
  }
});
```

This will result in request query params being sent out as follows

```
/items?per=5&pg=1
```

and ember-infinity will be set up to parse the total number of pages from a JSON response like this:

```js
{
  items: [
    ...
  ],
  meta: {
    total: 3
  }
}
```

You can also prevent the `per_page` or `page` parameters from being sent by setting `perPageParam` or `pageParam` to `null`, respectively.

### Cursor-based pagination

If you are serving a continuously updating stream, it's helpful to keep track
of your place in the list while paginating, to avoid duplicates. This is known
as **cursor-based pagination** and is common in popular APIs like Twitter,
Facebook, and Instagram. Instead of relying on `page_number` to paginate,
you'll want to extract the `min_id` or `min_updated_at` from each page of
results, so that you can fetch the next page without risking duplicates if new
items are added to the top of the list by other users in between requests.

To do this, implement the `afterInfinityModel` hook as follows:

```js
export default Ember.Route.extend(InfinityRoute, {
  _minId: undefined,
  _minUpdatedAt: undefined,
  _canLoadMore: true,

  model() {
    return this.infinityModel("post", {}, {
      min_id: '_minId',
      min_updated_at: '_minUpdatedAt'
    });
  },

  afterInfinityModel(posts) {
    loadedAny = posts.get('length') > 0;
    this.set('_canLoadMore', loadedAny);

    this.set('_minId', posts.get('lastObject.id'));
    this.set('_minUpdatedAt', posts.get('lastObject.updated_at').toISOString());
  }
});
```

### infinityModel

You can also provide additional static parameters to `infinityModel` that
will be passed to your backend server in addition to the
pagination params. For instance, in the following example a `category`
parameter is added:

```js
return this.infinityModel("product", { perPage: 12, startingPage: 1,
                                       category: "furniture" });
```

Bound Parameters has been DEPRECATED as the third argument to `infinityModel`.  
Please include as second argument to infinityModel.

* **modelPath**

`modelPath` is optional parameter for situations when you are overriding `setupController`
or when your model is on different location than `controller.model`.

```js
model() {
  return this.infinityModel("product", {
    perPage: 12,
    startingPage: 1,
    modelPath: 'controller.products'
  });
},
setupController(controller, model) {
  controller.set('products', model);
}
```

### afterInfinityModel

In some cases, a single call to your data store isn't enough. The afterInfinityModel
method is available for those cases when you need to chain together functions or
promises after fetching a model.

As a simple example, let's say you had a blog and just needed to set a property
on each Post model after fetching all of them:

```js
model() {
  return this.infinityModel("post");
},

afterInfinityModel(posts) {
  posts.setEach('author', 'Jane Smith');
}
```

As a more complex example, let's say you had a blog with Posts and Authors as separate
related models and you needed to extract an association from Posts. In that case,
return the collection you want from afterInfinityModel:

```js
model() {
  return this.infinityModel("post");
},

afterInfinityModel(posts) {
  return posts.mapBy('author').uniq();
}
```

afterInfinityModel should return either a promise, ArrayProxy, or a
falsy value.  The returned value, when not falsy, will take the place of the
resolved promise object and, if it is a promise, will hold execution until resolved.
In the case of a falsy value, the original promise result is used.

So relating this to the examples above... In the first example, afterInfinityModel
does not have an explicit return defined so the original posts promise result is used.
In the second example, the returned collection of authors is used.

### Event Hooks

The route mixin also provides following event hooks:

**infinityModelUpdated**

Triggered on the route whenever new objects are pushed into the infinityModel.

**Args:**

* totalPages

**infinityModelLoaded**

Triggered on the route when the infinityModel is fully loaded.

**Args:**

* lastPageLoaded

* totalPages

* infinityModel


```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import InfinityRoute from 'ember-infinity/mixins/route';

export default Ember.Route.extend(InfinityRoute, {
  ...

  model() {
    /* Load pages of the Product Model, starting from page 1, in groups of 12. */
    return this.infinityModel("product", { perPage: 12, startingPage: 1 });
  },

  infinityModelUpdated({ lastPageLoaded, totalPages, newObjects }) {
    Ember.Logger.debug('updated with more items');
  },
  infinityModelLoaded({ totalPages }) {
    Ember.Logger.info('no more items to load');
  }
}
```

### Custom store

Chances are you'll want to scroll some source other than the default ember-data store to infinity. You can do that by injecting it to the route and specify the store in the infinityModel options:

```js
export default Ember.Route.extend(InfinityRoute, {
  customStore: Ember.inject.service('my-custom-store'),

  model(params) {
    return this.infinityModel('product', {
      perPage: 12,
      startingPage: 1,
      store: 'customStore', // custom ember-data store or ember-redux / ember-cli-simple-store / your own hand rolled store (see dummy app)
      storeFindMethod: 'findAll' // should return a promise (optional if custom store method uses `query`)
    })
  }
});
```

### infinity-loader

The `infinity-loader` component as some extra options to make working with it easy!

* **destroyOnInfinity**

```hbs
{{infinity-loader infinityModel=model destroyOnInfinity=true}}
```

Now, when the Infinity Model is fully loaded, the `infinity-loader` will remove itself
from the page.

* **developmentMode**

```hbs
{{infinity-loader infinityModel=model developmentMode=true}}
```

This simply stops the `infinity-loader` from fetching triggering loads, so that
you can work on its appearance.

* **loadingText & loadedText**

```hbs
{{infinity-loader infinityModel=model loadingText="Loading..." loadedText="Loaded!"}}
```

By default, the `infinity-loader` will just output a `span` showing its status.

* **Providing a block**

```hbs
{{#infinity-loader infinityModel=model}}
  <img src="loading-spinner.gif" />
{{/infinity-loader}}
```

If you provide a block to the component, it will render the block instead of
rendering `loadingText` or `loadedText`. This will allow you to provide your
own custom markup or styling for the loading state.

* **reached-infinity Class Name**

```scss
.infinity-loader {
  background-color: wheat;
  &.reached-infinity {
    background-color: lavender;
  }
}

```

When the Infinity Model loads entirely, the `reached-infinity` class is added to the
component.

* **infinity-template Generator**

`ember generate infinity-template`

Will install the default `infinity-loader` template into your host app, at
`app/templates/components/infinity-loader`.

* **scrollable**

```hbs
{{infinity-loader scrollable="#content"}}
```

You can optionally pass in a jQuery style selector string.  If it's not a string,
scrollable will default to using the window for the scroll binding.

* **triggerOffset**

```hbs
{{infinity-loader triggerOffset=offset}}
```

You can optionally pass an offset value.   This value will be used when calculating if the bottom of the scrollable has been reached.  

### Use ember-infinity with button

You can use the route loading magic of Ember Infinity without using the InfinityLoader component.

load-more-button.js:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  loadText: 'Load more',
  loadedText: 'Loaded',
  click: function(){    
    this.sendAction('action', this.get('infinityModel'));
  }
});
```

load-more-button.hbs:

```hbs
{{#if infinityModel.reachedInfinity}}
  <button>{{loadedText}}</button>
{{else}}
  <button>{{loadText}}</button>
{{/if}}  
```
template.hbs:

```hbs
<ul class="test-list">
{{#each model as |item|}}
  <li>{{item.name}}</li>
{{/each}}
</ul>

{{load-more-button action='infinityLoad' infinityModel=model}}
```
